title: SERPL 2019 - The Southeast Regional Programming Languages Seminar
---

## What

SERPL is the Southeast Regional Programming Languages Seminar and
  seeks to bring together researchers in the design, analysis, and
  application of programming languages to build new collaborations
  among students and researchers in the Southeastern United States.
  SERPL's program consists of a full day of research talks from
  student researchers at the undergraduate and graduate
  level. Furthermore, SERPL is a venue for students to get feedback on
  their work before submission to a major conference.

  We are extremely excited to announce that the keynote speaker is:

  [**Alexis King**](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/) : Research programmer at [Northwestern University
  PLT](https://plt.eecs.northwestern.edu/) in Chicago, Illinois.

  - Talk Abstracts Due: April 10th, 2019
  - Notification of Acceptance: April 22th, 2019
  - Student Travel Grant Application Due: May 1st, 2019
  - Registration closes: May 1st, 2019
  - Seminar: May 11, 2019

## Where

SERPL will be held at the [Georgia Cyber Center

  There are several hotels near the GCC. Here are a few suggestions:

  - [Augusta Marriott at the Convention Center](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/agsmc-augusta-marriott-at-the-convention-center/?scid=bb1a189a-fec3-4d19-a255-54ba596febe2) - five minute walk to the GCC
  - [Holiday Inn Express Augusta Downtown](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/augusta/agsdt/hoteldetail?cm_mmc=GoogleMaps-_-EX-_-US-_-AGSDT)

  The GCC is in downtown Augusta, where there are tons of restaurants, pubs, and bars within walking distance.  

## Registration

Registration of all SERPL attendees is required
    and can be completed by submitting the SERPL [registration form](https://goo.gl/forms/Oeae43eUlqTYqTwi2).

## Scope

SERPL scope is kept very broad in order to allow as many people to
  contribute as possible, but the following is an incomplete list of
  topics for SERPL related research:
  
  - Programming Language Design
  - Implementation aspects of programming languages
  - Software-Development Techniques
  - Foundations of Programming Languages
  - Software Analysis
  - Applications of programming languages
  - Domain-specific languages
  - Programming-language related education
        
  The previous list of topics is not comprehensive, and if your topic
  is not listed, then this should not prevent you from submitting your
  work.

## Submissions

  Please submit in the form of a single PDF file a two page talk
  abstract.  All submissions should be prepared using LaTeX using the
  authors favorite style with a font size of no smaller than 11 points,
  and a margin of no smaller than one inch.

  All submission should be submitted via [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtcs3SewZ-Q5v0Ow8ccPCA8DK9WnRKVwbgDBxXE4zS57BkIQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

  There will be no formal proceedings, but all abstracts and slides
  will be posted on this site.

## Travel Support

SERPL is graciously supported by the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://nsf.gov/).

  We are accepting applications for student travel support to SERPL.

  In addition, we have set aside a portion of our student travel
  awards for funding undergraduate students, women, underrepresented
  minorities, and LBGTQ+ people.

  Student travel grant applications can be submitted by filling out
  the [student travel grant
  form](https://goo.gl/forms/rF9kE34nbN9Xte4Q2) before April 20th. The application
  requires a letter from the students research supervisor asserting
  that the student has no other means of funding to attend SERPL.
